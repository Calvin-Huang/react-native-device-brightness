*Hey, bro! react-native-device-brightness wasn't support older version of React Native yet.*

## Manually link

### iOS (without Cocoa Pods)
In XCode, in the project navigator:
- Right click _Libraries_
- Add Files to _[your project's name]_
- Go to `node_modules/react-native-device-brightness`
- Add the `.xcodeproj` file

In XCode, in the project navigator, select your project.
- Add the `libRNDeviceInfo.a` from the _deviceinfo_ project to your project's _Build Phases ➜ Link Binary With Libraries_
- Click `.xcodeproj` file you added before in the project navigator and go the _Build Settings_ tab. Make sure _All_ is toggled on (instead of _Basic_).
- Look for _Header Search Paths_ and make sure it contains both `$(SRCROOT)/../react-native/React` and `$(SRCROOT)/../../React`
- Mark both as recursive (should be OK by default).

Run your project (Cmd+R)

### Android

- in `android/app/build.gradle`:

```diff
dependencies {
    ...
    compile "com.facebook.react:react-native:+"  // From node_modules
+   compile project(':react-native-device-brightness')
}
```

- in `android/settings.gradle`:

```diff
...
include ':app'
+ include ':react-native-device-brightness'
+ project(':react-native-device-brightness').projectDir = new File(rootProject.projectDir, '../node_modules/react-native-device-brightness/android')
```

#### With React Native 0.29+

- in `MainApplication.java`:

```diff
+ import com.learnium.RNDeviceInfo.RNDeviceInfo;

  public class MainApplication extends Application implements ReactApplication {
    //......

    @Override
    protected List<ReactPackage> getPackages() {
      return Arrays.<ReactPackage>asList(
+         new RNDeviceInfo(),
          new MainReactPackage()
      );
    }

    ......
  }
```

#### With older versions of React Native:

- in `MainActivity.java`:

```diff
+ import com.learnium.RNDeviceInfo.RNDeviceInfo;

  public class MainActivity extends ReactActivity {
    ......

    @Override
    protected List<ReactPackage> getPackages() {
      return Arrays.<ReactPackage>asList(
+       new RNDeviceInfo(),
        new MainReactPackage()
      );
    }
  }
```

## Usage
**Important: Brightness Level only accept value 0 to 1.**

- *Adjusting screen brightness will make iOS's Auto-Brightness function do nothing.*
- *Adjusting screen brightness in Android only works in App and will reset to system setting exiting App.*
```javascript
// ES5
var DeviceBrightness = require('react-native-device-brightness');
// or ES6
// import DeviceBrightness from 'react-native-device-brightness';

// It will throw a exception when value less than 0 or more than 1.
DeviceBrightness.setBrightnessLevel(luminous);
DeviceBrightness.getBrightnessLevel()
    .then(function (luminous) {
        // Get current brightness level
        // 0 ~ 1
        console.log(luminous);
    });
//android only
DeviceBrightness.getSystemBrightnessLevel()
    .then(function (luminous) {
        // Get current brightness level
        // 0 ~ 1
        console.log(luminous);
    });
```
